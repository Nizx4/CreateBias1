          <h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms your existing beliefs.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> Only reading news that supports your political views while ignoring opposing perspectives.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Our brains want to avoid discomfort from conflicting information, so we seek out what feels familiar or "right."</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Actively seek out different viewpoints and challenge your own assumptions.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Anchoring Bias</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> Relying too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> If the first price you see for a phone is $1,000, all later prices seem cheap by comparison—even if they're still expensive.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The brain uses initial information as a mental shortcut, making it hard to adjust away from it.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Be aware of anchors and consider information from multiple sources before deciding.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Availability Heuristic</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> Overestimating the importance or frequency of events that come to mind easily.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> After seeing news about airplane crashes, you might think flying is more dangerous than it really is.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Events that are vivid or recent are easier to recall, making them seem more common.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Look for actual statistics and evidence, not just what’s memorable.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Dunning-Kruger Effect</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> People with low ability at something often overestimate their skill, while experts may underestimate theirs.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> A beginner at chess thinking they could beat a grandmaster after learning the rules.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Lack of knowledge makes it hard to recognize one’s own mistakes or gaps.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Stay humble, seek feedback, and keep learning—no matter your skill level.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Bandwagon Effect</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> The tendency to do or believe things because many other people do.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> Liking a song just because it’s popular, not because you actually enjoy it.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Social acceptance feels good, and we’re wired to fit in with groups.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Pause and ask yourself if you truly agree or just want to belong.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Loss Aversion</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> The tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring similar gains.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> Feeling more upset about losing $20 than happy about finding $20.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Losses trigger stronger emotional reactions than gains of the same size.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Focus on the bigger picture and long-term outcomes, not just avoiding losses.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Negativity Bias</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> Paying more attention to negative experiences than positive ones.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> Remembering one criticism for years but quickly forgetting compliments.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Our brains evolved to notice threats for survival, so negatives stand out.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Practice gratitude and intentionally focus on positive events.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Hindsight Bias</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> Believing, after something happens, that you "knew it all along."</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> After a sports game, claiming you always knew who would win.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Our minds reconstruct memories to make events seem more predictable.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Write down your predictions before events to check your accuracy later.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Self-Serving Bias</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> Attributing successes to yourself but blaming failures on outside factors.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> Taking credit for good grades but blaming bad ones on unfair teachers.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Protecting self-esteem feels good, so we unconsciously shift blame.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Reflect honestly on your actions and accept responsibility for mistakes.</section>
        </div>
        <div class="bias-card">
          <h3>Sunk Cost Fallacy</h3>
          <section><strong>What it is:</strong> Continuing something just because you’ve already invested time, money, or effort—even if it’s not working.</section>
          <section><strong>Example:</strong> Finishing a boring movie because you already watched an hour of it.</section>
          <section><strong>Why it happens:</strong> We want our past investments to “count,” so we avoid feeling wasteful.</section>
          <section><strong>How to reduce it:</strong> Focus on future benefits, not past costs, when making decisions.</section>
